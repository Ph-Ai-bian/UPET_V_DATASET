The data has been processed by using a Python script that processes images from the dataset input folder, detecting human poses using the MediaPipe library, and then saving resized versions of these images to an output folder. It begins by importing necessary libraries: OpenCV for image processing, MediaPipe for pose detection, and NumPy for numerical operations. The script initializes MediaPipe's pose detection module to operate in static image mode with a minimum detection confidence of 0.5. A function process_image is defined to handle the core processing tasks for each image. This function reads an image from a given file path, converts it to RGB, and uses MediaPipe to detect pose landmarks. If pose landmarks are found, the function calculates the bounding box coordinates around these landmarks, converts these relative coordinates to pixel coordinates, and crops the image accordingly. The cropped image is then resized to a specified output size (227x227 pixels) and returned. If no pose landmarks are detected, the function prints a warning message and returns None. The script then gathers a list of all image files (with .png, .jpg, or .jpeg extensions) from the input folder and processes each image in this list. For each image, it calls process_image, calculates and prints the processing progress, and saves the resized image to the output folder if pose landmarks were successfully detected. Finally, the script closes the MediaPipe pose model to release resources. This script automates the process of detecting and cropping human poses from images and saving resized versions of these cropped images, providing a streamlined way to prepare the dataset for further analysis.
